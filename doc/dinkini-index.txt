These are all the commands and info I could find out from the dink.ini file. 
I'm sure there's a few errors in here as I found most of this stuff out through 
trial and error as well as a bit of guessing. If you find any errors just email 
me (hertel@engr.orst.edu) I'll see if I can fix it.

1 = sequence
2 = frame (the frame of the sequence)
3 = frame delay (the length of the delay between frames)
4 = x coordinate center
5 = y coordinate center
6 = left hardbox boundary (in relation to the x center coordinate)
7 = top hardbox boundary (in relation to the y center coordinate)
8 = right hardbox boundary (in relation to the x center coordinate)
9 = bottom hardbox boundary (in relation to the y center coordinate)
10= destination sequence of the destination frame
11= destination frame to change frame to
12= frame that can hit target (usually the first frame in an attack sequence)
13= always equals -1 (I think), tells sequence to repeat itself.
BLACK - makes black the transparent color instead of white
NOTANIM - makes it so the sequence cannot be animated (I think)
LEFTALIGN - ???

// In addition, a sequence can be loaded later in the game with the following command:
